# Output Format Rules

`NOTE_STYLE.md` defines how notes should read. This file defines how they should be **delivered**.

## 1. Default Deliverable

Unless the student says otherwise, produce **files**, not chat text.

For each source document (each chapter, deck, or lecture), produce:

- one `.docx`
- one `.html`

Both contain the same content. The `.docx` opens in Word and Google Docs. The `.html` opens in a browser and prints in color.

**One file per source.** If the student uploads three chapters, produce three sets of files, not one combined document.

If the student uploads material that is clearly meant to be studied together, also offer a combined version — but do not create it unless asked.

### When to answer in chat instead

- The student asks a question about the material rather than asking for notes
- The student asks for a quick definition, correction, or clarification
- The material is very short (a single slide, a few lines of notes)

## 2. Color Is Required, and Color Must Mean Something

Markdown cannot display color reliably. HTML and Word can. Use real color in those formats.

Never use color as decoration. Every color must encode information the student can decode.

### The Standard Color System

| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Amber block** | Possible test material (unconfirmed) |
| **Red block** | Confirmed test priority (see `TEST_PRIORITY.md`) |
| **Amber cell** | A specific number worth memorizing |
| **Blue column** | First side of a two-way comparison |
| **Orange column** | Opposing side of a two-way comparison |
| **Deepening tint** | A sequence — darker means later in the process |
| **Chapter accent** | One accent color per chapter, used on headings |
| **Grey dashed box** | A gap, ambiguity, or item to verify |

### Always Include a Legend

Every document opens with a short "What the colors mean" key. A color system the student has to guess at is worse than no color.

## 3. How Color Maps to Content Types

**Comparison tables.** Any two-way comparison gets contrasting column colors so the student can read across in one glance. Utilitarianism vs. rights and duties, VMI vs. co-managed inventories, transactional vs. analytic — all of these.

**Process and step tables.** Any numbered sequence gets a tint that deepens with the step number, so position in the process is visible without reading the numbers.

**Numbers.** Specific figures the student may need to recall — thresholds, counts, percentages, totals — get a highlighted cell rather than being buried in a sentence.

**Worked examples.** Highlight the cells that carry the lesson. In a weighted scorecard, highlight the heaviest and lightest weights, because the contrast is the point.

## 4. Typography and Layout

- One accent color per chapter, applied to headings and callout borders
- Sans-serif for tables and labels; serif or clean sans for body text
- Body text under roughly 75 characters per line
- Generous white space between major sections
- Print-friendly: white background, colors that survive a printer

## 5. Naming

Name files so they sort and scan well:

`Ch3_Supplier_Relationships_Notes.docx`

Format: `Ch[number]_[Short_Topic]_Notes.[ext]`

## 6. Do Not

- Do not deliver a wall of chat text when the student asked for notes
- Do not use color without a legend
- Do not use color decoratively
- Do not combine separate chapters into one file unless asked
- Do not describe visual details that carry no meaning
